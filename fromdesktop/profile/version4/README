Current Bottleneck:
In our final version the free_memory function takes the most time still.
Almost all of the other functions are very small with not much
more than one or two percent of the computation time. However, 
free_memory takes around 50% of the total time because of the inefficient
nested loop. This is because all of the unmapped segments are searched each
time the check is done to see if the segment data needs to be freed.
The assembly code could be improved here with constant run time using an
extra array that uses more memory, but does not have as much computational
overhead.

Hours spent:
	Analyzing: 1 hour
	Solving the problem: 6
