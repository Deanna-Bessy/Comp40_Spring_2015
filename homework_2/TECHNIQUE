Help/collaboration: We received help from a few different TAs. 

What has been implemented correctly: All parts specified in the assignment. 

Selections from design document: 

	Part A:
	Two-Dimensional, Polymorphic, Unboxed Arrays 

	Uarray2 represents an unboxed 2D array of elements,
	using a single Uarray, with the invariant being the index of an element 
	at position [x,y] in the 2d array equals col*x + y. 

	Part B:
	Two-Dimensional Arrays of Bits

	Bit2 represents a 2D bitmap using a single Bit vector, with the 
	invariant being the index of a bit at
	position [x,y] in the 2d bitmap equals col*x+y.

Approximate time spent: 23 hours
